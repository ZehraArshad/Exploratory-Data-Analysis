## How to approach data for different models?

### KNN
- Standard Scaling
- Experiment with different K values

**when k=3** ‚è¨

**when k=5** ‚è¨

</br>

**when k=7** ‚è¨

<br/>

- We can conclude that we will need fix the input for better results


### Decision Tree

same pre-process as knn

- Its hard to figure out an improvment as features are not impacting results properly

### Random Forest, LogReg

- All of them are showing accuracy no more than 50%
- This indicates that data is not good for predictions

### Kmeans

## Missed Arrows


- Not scaling returns same accuracy 
- changing threshold of amouunt from median to near mean (5000) doesn't make much difference
