- Outlier is a value very different from the patter
- It is not necessary that it is always an error
- gender = [0,0,0,1,1,0, ..... 999] - Here **999** is an outlier and an error
- age = [18, 16, 15, ...,45] here **45** is not an outlier because there is some aged 45 in the data
- sometimes, we remove these outliers, sometimes we don't, depends on the **Domain Knowledge**
- But it can affect the mean alot, so use medians
