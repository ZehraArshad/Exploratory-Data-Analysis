# Scaling

### Age
- Age is in **years**
- Age is between **18 - 50**

### Marks
- Marks are between **0-100**

  We will scale it between 0 (min in both cases) and 1 (max in both cases)

After scaling:

  Age = 65 = 0.5
  Marks = 50 = 0.5

  This is especially useful when we compare someone with *age* 30 and *marks* 0f 30

### Techniques
- MinMaxScaler
- Z score Scaling
