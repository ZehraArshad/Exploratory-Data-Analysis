## Where to use Standard Deviation?



Because, sometimes we wanna figure how how spread the data is from mean/avg.

</br>
Sometimes, the Mean Absolute deviation calculated by Abs(Avg-data points) might be same for diff data thats where we use square instead of ABS. That formula then becomes that of the STD and can be used to figure what is the spread of data.

### Practical Demo

It is when we use L1 (MAD), L2(STD)


## Where to use logarithmic trans

- when we have some values that are too high, some are way less. For eg. Bank Investments, Earthquake scales like 5. 6,7 \


  ## Where to use sin, cosine, tan?

  - Iphone docs will have more iphone than galaxy and vice versa
  -  can figure out that 3(iphone):1(galaxy) - > Iphone doc
  -  but in real world it is not possible because
  -  Iphone 3, Galaxy 2, Pixel 1 , ...

Cosine distance = 1- costheta


## Ab Testing
- testing on diff groups to check whether a or b. Its a practical application of Hypothesis Testing

## Hypothesis Testing

Following are some ways to do hypothesis testing where we reject a null hypothesis (widely accepted, general truth) to prove alternative 
- anova
- z test
- t test
- chi square
